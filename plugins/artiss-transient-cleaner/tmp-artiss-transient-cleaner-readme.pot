msgid "\"Transients are a simple and standardized way of storing cached data in the WordPress database temporarily by giving it a custom name and a timeframe after which it will expire and be deleted.\""
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "Unfortunately, expired entries will only be deleted if you attempt to access the transient again. If you don't access the transient then, even though it's expired, WordPress will not remove it. This is <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20316\" title=\"Ticket #20316\">a known \"issue\"</a> but due to reason, which are explained in the FAQ, have not been resolved."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "Why is this a problem? Transients are often used by plugins to \"cache\" data (my own plugins included). Because of the housekeeping problems this means that expired data can be left and build up, resulting in a bloated database table."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "Meantime, this plugin is the solution, using the same proposed method as the WordPress core change will use. Simply activate the plugin, sit back and enjoy a much cleaner, smaller options table. It also adds the additional recommendation that after a database upgrade all transients will be cleared down."

You can also request an optimization of the options table to give your system a real \"pep\"!"

msgid "An attempt was made and lots of discussions ensued. Basically, some plugins don't use transients correctly and they use them as required storage instead of temporary cache data. This would mean any attempt by WordPress core to regularly housekeep transients may break some plugins and, hence, websites. WordPress didn't want to do this."

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Yes, they implemented the clearing down of all transients upon a database upgrade. However, they don't optimise the table after, which this plugin does. So we have retained our version of this funcionality. This could mean that the WordPress may run and ours as well but, well, if it's already been cleared then the second run isn't going to do anything so it doesn't add any overheads - it just ensures the optimisation occurs, no matter what."

msgid "This can happen when transients become \"orphaned\". Each transient consists of 2 record - one holds the expiry time and the other the actual data. If one is removed without the other then this will then cause problems for the scheduled housekeeping."

msgid "In this situation the Database Upgrade run, which removes all transients even if they're orphaned, will be the solution."
