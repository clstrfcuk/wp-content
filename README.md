# wp-content

Basically a kickstart package I built for Vagrant.

It will simply be initiated with the command

vv create -b kickstart -gr https://github.com/clstrfcuk/wp-content/

and then added to a fresh WordPress installation. Then I have all my standard plugins and themes I usually work with integrated in a new developement enviroment.
